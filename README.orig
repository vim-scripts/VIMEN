Motivation of VIMEN

The ideal IDE in my mind must has the following features:
1. can work with VIM which is my favorite editor.
2. can work with GCC/GDB.
3. can INTEGRATE with different external tools if necessary
4. Small and Fast.
5. can run in different OS: Windows, Linux, Solaris

Well, none of existed IDEs could meet my request:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
         | VIM         GCC/GDB   INTEGRATE Small   Fast    OS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
MSVC     | No          No        Bad       2 Bad   OK      No
Eclipse  | Not Really  Yes       Good      2 Bad   Bad     Yes
Netbeans | Yes         DONT KNOW Good      Bad     2 Bad   Yes
EMACS    | Not Really  Yes       Good      OK      Good    Yes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

So, I have to make one for myself, and maybe it is useful for the VIM fans.

VIMEN means: VIM Is More than Editor Now.

HOW To Use
----------
1. Easy, just like this:
    python vimen.py <your_executable_file>
2. In opened VIM window, you can use the following function key:
  <F5>    start/continue debugging
  <F6>    toggel break point
  <F7>    step into
  <F8>    step over
  <S-F7>  step out
  <C-F8>  step until
  <S-F5>  stop debugging
  <F12>   set program arguments
3. A Balloon Value Function is also available.
